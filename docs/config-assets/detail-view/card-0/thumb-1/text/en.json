  "description": "\"We aim to create a warm, comfortable, and inspiring learning environment for children, allowing them to grow happily and learn through exploration,\" say the principal and designers. To create a colorful and varied learning environment, they intend to build a campus with distinctive features. \nThis set of design proposals starts from the kindergarten's own characteristics, not only helping stimulate children's learning interest and creativity but also elevating the kindergarten's overall image and brand value. As the first small society that children encounter, the choice of environmental colors has a significant impact on their growth and psychological development. To create a warm, harmonious, safe, and inspiring learning environment, we have decided to adopt the Morandi color scheme as our brand color. Characterized by its soft, low-key yet elegant hues, Morandi colors perfectly fit the educational philosophy and atmospheric requirements of this project.",
